This Xcode project is a convenience for browsing and editing the source code
under macOS.
Maybe compiling an isolated file to check for syntax errors.
It is *not* a replacement for the current cmake based build system.

This project was created under Xcode 10.1 so that macOS 10.13 High Sierra
could be used for development.
Please only update the Xcode project files on github with Xcode 10.1.
Source code can be updated with any version.
